//! This is a pure Rust implementation of Freestyle Sculpting, a real-time dynamic topology sculpting algorithm.
//!
//! It is based on the paper [Freestyle: Sculpting meshes with self-adaptive topology](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00606516/document) by Lucian Stanculescu, Raphaëlle Chaine, Marie-Paule Cani. This is the same algorithm that is used by the Dyntopo sculpting mode in Blender.
//!
//! ![Freestyle Sculpt Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Synphonyte/freestyle-sculpt/refs/heads/main/docs/freestyle-demo.webp)
//!
//! Please check out the [bevy-basic-sculpt example](https://github.com/Synphonyte/freestyle-sculpt/tree/main/examples/bevy-basic-sculpt) to see how it can be used in an interactive application.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! At the moment it doesn't support topology genus changes, i.e. no splitting or merging of different parts of the mesh.
//!
//! ## Optional Cargo features
//!
//! - `rerun`: Enables recording of the mesh graph and the different algorithms to [Rerun](https://rerun.io/) for visualization.
//! - `bevy`: Enables integration with the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine.
//!
//! ## Customize sculpting
//!
//! To implement a custom deformation field, you can create a struct that implements the [`DeformationField`] trait. Have a look
//! at the existing deformation fields in the [`deformation`] module for inspiration.
//!
//! If you want to implement a custom selection strategy, you can create a struct that implements the [`MeshSelector`] trait. Have a look
//! at the existing selection strategies in the [`selectors`] module for inspiration.
